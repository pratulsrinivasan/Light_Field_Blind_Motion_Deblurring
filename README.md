### Contents

This repository contains:
1) Light_Field_Blind_Motion_Deblurring.ipynb Jupyter notebook with an implementation of our light field blind deblurring algorithm.

[Data and Results File](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pratul/code/deblur_data_results.zip) contains:
1) Data folder with mat files containing light fields used in our paper.
2) Results folder with mat files containing results from our paper.
3) parameters_to_use.txt Text file with suggested algorithm parameters to use for these examples.

### Dependencies

This code depends on a working installation of Tensorflow and basic Python libraries (numpy, scipy, matplotlib).
